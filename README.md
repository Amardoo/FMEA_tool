About the FMEA web Application for Blood Donation and Transfusion

The FMEA (Failure Modes and Effects Analysis) web-based application is designed to support blood banks and healthcare facilities in systematically identifying, evaluating, and mitigating risks across the blood donation and transfusion process. It enhances patient safety by providing a structured, data-driven framework for detecting potential failures before they impact clinical outcomes.

This tool aligns with modern risk management and quality assurance standards in transfusion medicine. By integrating FMEA methodology into daily operations, it enables healthcare professionals to monitor, analyze, and continuously improve process reliability — from donor screening to post-transfusion follow-up.

Key Features and Benefits:

Guided workflows for documenting process steps and potential failure modes

Automated calculation of Risk Priority Numbers (RPN) to rank critical risks

Real-time visualization of risk levels through interactive dashboards and charts

Evidence-based reporting tools for quality audits and regulatory compliance

Secure data management and role-based user access for multi-department use

By transforming complex risk assessments into clear, actionable insights, the FMEA web tool empowers blood bank professionals to strengthen transfusion safety, ensure regulatory alignment, and foster a culture of continuous quality improvement in healthcare.
